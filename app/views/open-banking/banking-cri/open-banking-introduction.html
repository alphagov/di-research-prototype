          Signing in to online banking can help us be sure you are who you say you are. <br><br>

          This is because banks have very strong security, so they can be sure it is you signing in, not someone with your details pretending to be you. <br><br>
          
          Your bank will confirm the information you’ve given us to prove your identity.
