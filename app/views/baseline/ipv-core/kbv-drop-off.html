    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you can do</h2>
    <p>Based on what you’ve told us, you have a photo ID you can use to prove your identity.</p>
    <p>You can do this online with the GOV.UK ID Check app if you have:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>an iPhone 7 or higher</li>
      <li>an Android phone (for example, Samsung or Google Pixel)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also prove your identity at a Post Office. This option takes longer. You’ll usually get an outcome within a day of going to the Post Office. </p>
