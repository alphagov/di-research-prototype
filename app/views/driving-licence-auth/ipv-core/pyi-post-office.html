        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Prove your identity at a Post Office</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">You may be able to prove your identity at a Post Office instead.</p>
        <p>You'll be asked to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>enter details from your photo ID on GOV.UK</li>
            <li>go to a Post Office where they’ll scan your ID and take a photo of you</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will take longer than proving your identity online. You’ll usually get a result within a day of going to the Post Office.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Types of photo ID you can use at a Post Office</h2>
        <p>You’ll need one of the following:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>a UK photocard driving licence (full or provisional)</li>
            <li>a UK passport</li>
            <li>a non-UK passport</li>
            <li>a UK biometric residence permit (BRP)</li>
            <li>a European Union (EU) photocard driving licence</li>
            <li>a national identity card from a European Economic Area (EEA) country</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          You cannot prove your identity at a Post Office with a Frontier Worker permit (FWP) or a UK biometric residence card (BRC), also called a UK residence card.
